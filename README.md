# File-Organizer
 A global command line application using Node.js to organizes all files from a folder into similar category so that you need not to do it manually.

-> I have implemented three commands

    -Show the files and folders by using a particular format as tree.
    
2->organise.js
    -Organise the folders with their respective file extensions as media, document, archives and app.\
    
3->help.js
